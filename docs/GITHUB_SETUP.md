# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Create New Repository on GitHub

### Option 1: Via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `ngx-codegen` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Token-based design system with 140+ React components, Tailwind CSS, and Figma integration`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"
4. Copy the repository URL (will be something like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ngx-codegen.git`)

### Option 2: Via GitHub CLI

```bash
gh repo create ngx-codegen --public --description "Token-based design system with 140+ React components, Tailwind CSS, and Figma integration" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## After Creating the Repo

Once you have the repository URL, I'll help you push the code!

Just provide me with the repository URL and I'll handle the rest.
